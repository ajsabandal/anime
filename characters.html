                Okabe has the characteristics of a lanky young man, with a square jaw and bony cheeks. He has his short black hair swept
                back and has brown irises, with a small amount of stubble on his chin. Rintaro also wears a lab coat, which
                he wears over a simple shirt and slacks. In the game, Okabe appeared much "dustier". His face was pale and
                unshaven and he seemed a lot more "messy" in contrast to his relatively "clean" appearance in the anime.
